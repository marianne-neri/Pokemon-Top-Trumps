# Pokemon-Top-Trumps

For my Coding Kickstarter (Introduction to Python & Apps) final project, I created a Pokemon Top Trumps game. 
This is a console-based game, where the user inputs on the console and plays against the computer (called Kiwi).

1. The user selects from two randomised Pokemon - made easier with user input being '1' or '2'. 
2. The user selects a stat they want to play - made easier using abbreviations (a - attack, s - speed and d - defence). 
3. Both Step 1 and 2 are programmed defensively - the user must input a valid response. 
4. The computer selects a Pokemon and associated stat.
5. The player with the higher stat wins the round.
6. The first player to win 3 points will be the winner!
7. The user has the option to play again.
